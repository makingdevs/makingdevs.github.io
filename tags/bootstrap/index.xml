      <description>It has been a while since I make a post and this is my first post in English so be gentle with me :P
Since a couple of months I been working in a language called elixir and with his web framework phoenix, I have had a lot of fun with these elements. But sometimes I been struggling with configurations that should be easy maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t read that carefully or maybe I&amp;rsquo;m a knucklehead, but whatever the reasone is, I hope this configuration works for you and give you a little help of how configure your Javascripts third parties for your Phoenix application.</description>
