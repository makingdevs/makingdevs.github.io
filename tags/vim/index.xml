      <description>A few weeks ago, while I was tracking and debugging a system in which I&amp;rsquo;m currently working, the client told me that another part of the system was having troubles.
Suddenly, I&amp;rsquo;m on verge of close all the Vim&amp;rsquo;s buffer I&amp;rsquo;ve just opened because I need to switch branches meaning that I need a way to know in which files I was working before closing them.
Needless to say, it was hard to found those files and I even haven&amp;rsquo;t made a change in them (I have just found them) Additionally, is a huge project with a lot of micro projects so, at this point, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know in which project I was working (I know my mistake).</description>
